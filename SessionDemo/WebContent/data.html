<!--Stateless : Server does not maintain the state of the client. That is, when the response is delivered, the server simply forgets the client. If the client wants the same data, it must again establish a new connection, send request and receive response and the same earlier process is to be repeated. For this reason, HTTP protocol is treated as stateless protocol.  -->

<!--Connectionless : When the response is delivered, the connection between client and server is destroyed. By chance, if the same client would like to contact the same server again, the client should establish altogether a new connection. To put in a simple way, if the client would like to request the same server 100 times, the client should establish a new connection 100 times as the server closes the connection for each request when the response is delivered.-->
